                <h2><a id="link" href="pag/scarcy-en.html">A Reflection on the Italian Constitution</a></h2>
                <p>The prohibition of arms in the Italian Constitution is crucial for a democratic and peaceful state, ensuring security through centralized control of the armed forces by the State. Rooted in post-war history, this prohibition promotes stability and national cohesion, while allowing exceptions for law enforcement and specific purposes. Public debate reflects various interpretations, with some emphasizing violence prevention and others the right to self-defense. Ultimately, this provision reflects the values of Italian society, emphasizing collective security, peace, and democracy.</p>

                <h2><a id="link" href="pag/marinelli-en.html">Italy and the United States of America</a></h2>
                <p>The relations between Italy and the United States, which began in 1861, became strategically important during the Cold War. As a founding member of NATO, Italy has actively contributed to the Alliance's military missions, providing bases and resources. Modern relations are characterized by close military cooperation and strong cultural and commercial ties.</p>

                <p>Italy has a vast network of clients worldwide, with major buyers including countries like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, India, Turkey, and European Union countries. However, arms exports have sparked controversy and criticism from human rights organizations and pacifists, who contest the sale of weapons to authoritarian regimes and conflict-ridden countries.</p>
