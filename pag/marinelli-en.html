                <p>The relations between Italy and the United States of America formally began in 1861. During World War II, Italy was an ally of Germany and a major component of the Axis powers. However, in 1943, with the expulsion of Mussolini from power and the appointment of Pietro Badoglio as the new head of government, an armistice was signed with the Allies, ceasing hostilities. After Mussolini's death, the liberation from the Nazis and fascists by the Partisans, and the end of World War II, Italy became one of the American bases during the Cold War. Italy and the United States are NATO allies and cooperate in the UN, various regional and bilateral organizations. Additionally, they collaborate together against drug trafficking, human trafficking, and terrorism.</p>

                    <p>- Foundation of NATO: Italy is one of the 12 founding countries of NATO, with the signing of the Washington Treaty in 1949. This treaty established the Atlantic Alliance as an organization of collective defense for the security of its members.</p>
                    <p>- Italy's Strategic Role: During the Cold War, Italy always played a proactive role within the Alliance, showing full adherence to the principles of unity and solidarity. In the last 30 years, NATO has transformed its internal structure, moving from the bipolar logic of the Cold War to a concept of integrated security. In this context, Italy is strongly committed not only to deterrence and defense activities, but also to strengthening partnership relations with other countries and international organizations.</p>
                    <p>- Participation in Missions and Operations: Italy has provided significant resources in terms of economic and human resources to the main missions and operations of NATO. From Afghanistan to Kosovo, from Iraq to Libya, Italy has continuously participated actively to ensure stability at the Alliance's borders.</p>
                    <p>- Integrated NATO Structures in Italy: Italy hosts numerous integrated Alliance structures, including the Allied Joint Force Command in Naples, which plays a crucial role in ensuring stability in the Mediterranean area and other regions.</p>
